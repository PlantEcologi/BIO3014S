### This is a discussion, not a lecture. These slides may not make much sense in isolation...

## Lecture 1, Slide 11:

### The tough questions...

- Where should we put (or expand) protected areas?
- How do we ensure the effectiveness of our protected areas?
- How do we protect biodiversity outside protected areas?

--

Answering these requires (key themes):
  - Mapping biodiversity
  - Identifying and assessing threats to biodiversity
  - Deciding on biodiversity conservation priorities
  - Optimising trade-offs in priorities for protected area design
  - Tools to inform management
    - Early warning systems
    - Monitoring change in biodiversity and other key variables (e.g. fire, land cover change, etc)

# Cross-cutting themes

- Local vs Global: priorities, policy, planning, analyses and actions

--

- Policy:
    - Global: CBD - Aichi targets, Global Biodiversity Framework, SDGs, etc
    - National Legislation: NEM:BA
    - National policy tools/instruments/informants: NBA, NBSAPs, National Protected Area Expansion Strategies
    - Provincial and municipal policies and plans

--

- Information to action pipeline:
    - Indicators - for reporting nationally and to global commitments (e.g. CBD)
    - Maps - for application in planning (e.g. priorities) and management
    - Messaging - focus on creating light (awareness) vs heat (conflict)

--

- Inside vs outside protected areas
    - Protected area effectiveness and management tools (I)
    - Protected area expansion/design (O)
    - Land use planning and EIAs (O)
    - Restoration and sustainable use (O)
    
---

# Cross-cutting themes cont.

- Measuring impact (often comparing inside vs outside PAs)
    - Effectiveness of protected areas / Impact of conservation actions 
    - Attribution and additionality (are we doing better than the baseline)
    - TNC planning for impact (i.e. prioritising sites with the greatest threats)

--

- Expanding set of priorities
    - Biodiversity > ecosystem services > climate change > human well-being
    - Clear in IUCN timeline, but also in Glenn and Andrew's talks re TNC and SANBI approach
    - More hooks to achieve conservation, but also more complexity and trade-offs!
    
--

- Increased focus on repeatability/reproducibility of methods
    - allow regular updates and comparisons over time or between regions/countries
    - transparency and trust

- Increased focus on forecasting 
    - of impacts - to help plan/prioritise conservation actions
    - of biodiversity - to help decision making and/or assess effectiveness of conservation actions

# Other observations

Evolution of Remote Sensing:
- From measuring the environment to direct measures of biodiversity
- From single date to time series
- From single sensor to multiple sensors
- Complex models to integrate multiple data sources

Ralph's approach vs prac?
- Prac = supervised classification
    - We specified the classes and training data
- Ralph = unsupervised classification + field validation
    - Let the data tell us what the classes are
    - Needs validation!
    - Some level of expert input through decisions on input data and number of classes

We're starting to directly map components of biodiversity...
