## "The completion of conservation planning..."

### [Brooks 2010 in _Conservation Biology for All_](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199554232.003.0012)

 "...conservation planning is a discipline with its completion in sight. It is not too far of a stretch to imagine a day where..." [we have]:
 
- complete and continuous updating of IUCN Red List assessments of all species [and ecosystems]
- iterative identification of key biodiversity areas, representing all sites of global conservation significance
- measurement and mapping of:
    - the continuous global surface of seascape and landscape scale ecological processes necessary to retain these species and sites into the future
    - the threats to these species, sites, and sea/landscapes, and of the costs and benefits of conserving them.
- free, electronic, continuously updated access to these datasets, and tools for their interpretation, planning, and prioritization

> "A particularly important characteristic of such a vision is its iterative nature."

## My take?

We'll never be able to automate conservation planning (and actions), but we certainly can do better to automate (or at east semi-automate) data collection, processing (including modelling) and dissemination to decision makers.

## Spectral unmixing can detect "spectral signatures"

Map species or cover types based on their reflectance of the electromagnetic spectrum!

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '40%'}

Given a library of spectral signatures of different species and land cover types (endmembers), spectral unmixing infers the composition of each pixel from the possible mixes of endmembers. This gives a cover map of the majority endmember for each pixel (as here) and the fraction of each endmember for all pixels (next slide).

## Take-home

>*Spatially explicit biodiversity and environmental data, monitored over the long term, but made available in near-real-time, are a critical basis for conservation planning and management*
> - *satellite remote sensing is pretty much the only way this can be achieved*

>*There are many ways to measure biodiversity (or factors affecting biodiversity like fire or weather), and satellite data can be used to measure a large number of them*

>*The number and variety of satellite sensor types is rapidly expanding, providing new and better ways to measure biodiversity all the time!*

>*Some aspects of biodiversity are not directly observable from satellites (e.g. small species, or diversity metrics like species richness or phylogenetic diversity), but can often be inferred using proxies or models.*

>*Ground data are essential for calibrating and validating almost any remotely-sensed data product.*

>*Local understanding of the ecology of the species or ecosystems under study is essential for the interpretation (and often analysis) of almost any biodiversity-related remote sensing product*
> - *Many global products fall short because of this issue*
