Is putting a fence around it enough?

## Protected area effectiveness

Protected Areas (PAs) cover ~17% of land and ~8% of oceans ***BUT*** Climate change is reshaping ecosystems and undermining their effectiveness at protecting biodiversity...

---

 **Key Questions:**  
  1. How does climate change affect PAs?
  2. How can we manage these impacts?
  3. Can PAs contribute to climate solutions?  
  4. How should we rethink conservation in a changing climate?  

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

- Explain how climate change threatens biodiversity inside PAs.  
- Assess the role of PAs in both adaptation and mitigation.  
- Critically evaluate strategies for climate-smart conservation.  

---

## The Assumptions of Protecting Area...

- Setting land aside should:  
  - Safeguard species and ecosystems.  
  - Provide ecosystem services.  

- But this assumed:  
  - Habitats and species ranges are stable.  
  - Static boundaries suffice.

## Climate Change Impacts on PAs

**Direct impacts:**
- Species loss, or range shifts towards cooler areas.  
- Phenological mismatches (e.g. flowers and pollinators).  
- Habitat loss (corals, alpine, Arctic).  

**Indirect impacts:**
- Invasive species.  
- Disturbance regimes (fire, storms, pests).  
- Hydrological change.

## Case Study: Kruger National Park

- Altered rainfall and fire regimes.  
- Shifts in vegetation and herbivore dynamics.  
- Management challenge: balancing biodiversity, tourism, and resilience.

## Protecting Areas under Climate Change

**Adaptation options**  
- Climate refugia.  
- Corridors and connectivity.  
- Dynamic, adaptive management.  

---

## Protected Areas and Climate Mitigation?

**Mitigation roles:** 

- Carbon storage (forests, peatlands, mangroves).  
- Avoided deforestation.  
- REDD+ and policy integration.

## Protected Areas and Climate Mitigation?

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%', fig.cap = "Differences in Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD), forest height, canopy cover, and Plant Area Index (PAI) between PAs and matched unprotected areas."}

## Climate Policy Context

- **Paris Agreement** synergies.  
- Nature-based solutions at global scale.

## Traditional vs. Climate-Smart PAs

.pull-left[
### Traditional
- Isolated reserves  
- Static boundaries  
- Species assumed stable  
- Vulnerable to climate change  
]
️
.pull-right[
### Climate-Smart
- Networks & connectivity  
- Refugia & buffer zones  
- Adaptive management  
- Integrated with people & landscapes  
- Mitigation via carbon storage  
]

---

## Wrap-up

- Climate change undermines the static PA model.  
- Climate-smart approaches require connectivity, adaptation, and integration.  
- Conservation may need to shift focus from protecting *places* to protecting *processes*.  

---

## Discussion

> Should conservation shift from protecting **places** to protecting **processes** under climate change?
