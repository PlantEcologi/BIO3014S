## The Assumptions of Protecting Area...

.pull-left[
- Setting land aside should:  
  - Safeguard species and ecosystems
  - Provide ecosystem services

- But this assumes:  
  - Habitats and species ranges are stable
  - Static boundaries suffice  
  - Pressures can be kept out
  - Necessary processes are intact and do not rely on unprotected areas
      - (e.g. fire, hydrology, migration)
  - Protected areas are effectively managed...

## Protected area effectiveness?

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'centre', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/protected_areas_map.png")
```

Protected Areas (PAs) cover ~17% of land and ~8% of oceans ***BUT*** climate change and other threats are reshaping ecosystems and undermining their effectiveness at protecting biodiversity...

.footnote[Global protected areas from [Bingham et al. 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-0869-3)]

## Determinants of Protected Area Effectiveness

.pull-left[
The effectiveness of a protected area in achieving the desired conservation outcomes is influenced by two main factors:

- **Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME)**: How well the PA is managed, including planning, enforcement, resource allocation, and community engagement.
- **Change Drivers**: External pressures such as climate change, invasive species, pollution, altered ecosystem processes and land-use change that can impact the PA's ecosystems and biodiversity and the extent to which we can mitigate or adapt to them.

Unfortunately, both are hugely challenging!

## Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME)

.pull-left[

There are a number of different PAME methodologies, but most are based on a similar framework and share common elements, e.g.:
- Planning: Clear objectives, zoning, and management plans.
- Resources: Adequate funding, staffing, and infrastructure.
- Enforcement/implementation: Effective patrolling, law enforcement and other management activities.
- Community Engagement: Involving local communities and stakeholders.
- Monitoring and Evaluation: Regular assessment of management effectiveness and ecological outcomes.

## Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME)

.pull-left[

Very few indicators scored above 50% on average, let alone the 67% level for sound management...

<br>

South Africa is among the better countries for assessing PAME globally, but there is still much room for improvement!

## Change Drivers?

Protected areas are subject to all the usual suspects...

Some of these they are aimed at combating (e.g. habitat loss), while others may not have been anticipated when the PA was established (e.g. climate change, invasive species).

Some can be managed, given sufficient resources (e.g. invasive species), while others are largely out of the control of PA managers (e.g. climate change).

- many are intensifying, and most interact...
- we don't fully understand how they'll affect biodiversity, or how best to manage their impacts...

More extreme weather in the first summer after fires cause local species loss.

## Multiple Dimensions of Climate Change...

Garcia paper

---


## Key Questions:

  1. How do global change drivers like climate change affect PAs?
  2. How can we manage these impacts?
  3. Can PAs contribute to climate solutions?  
  4. How should we rethink conservation under global change?  

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

- Explain how climate change threatens biodiversity inside PAs.  
- Assess the role of PAs in both climate change adaptation and mitigation.  
- Critically evaluate strategies for climate-smart conservation.  




---

## Climate Change Impacts on PAs

**Direct impacts:**
- Species loss, or range shifts towards cooler areas.  
- Phenological mismatches (e.g. flowers and pollinators).  
- Habitat loss (corals, alpine, Arctic).  

**Indirect impacts:**
- Invasive species.  
- Disturbance regimes (fire, storms, pests).  
- Hydrological change.

## Case Study: Kruger National Park

- Altered rainfall and fire regimes.  
- Shifts in vegetation and herbivore dynamics.  
- Management challenge: balancing biodiversity, tourism, and resilience.

## Protecting Areas under Climate Change

**Adaptation options**  
- Climate refugia.  
- Corridors and connectivity.  
- Dynamic, adaptive management.  

---

## Protected Areas and Climate Mitigation?

**Mitigation roles:** 

- Carbon storage (forests, peatlands, mangroves).  
- Avoided deforestation.  
- REDD+ and policy integration.

## Traditional vs. Climate-Smart PAs

.pull-left[
### Traditional
- Isolated reserves  
- Static boundaries  
- Species assumed stable  
- Vulnerable to climate change  
]
ï¸
.pull-right[
### Climate-Smart
- Networks & connectivity  
- Refugia & buffer zones  
- Adaptive management  
- Integrated with people & landscapes  
- Mitigation via carbon storage  
]

---

## Wrap-up

- Climate change undermines the static PA model.  
- Climate-smart approaches require connectivity, adaptation, and integration.  
- Conservation may need to shift focus from protecting *places* to protecting *processes*.  

---

## Discussion

> Should conservation shift from protecting **places** to protecting **processes** under climate change?
