## The Assumptions of Protecting Area...

.pull-left[
- Setting land aside should:  
  - Safeguard species and ecosystems
  - Provide ecosystem services

- But this assumes:  
  - Habitats and species ranges are stable
  - Static boundaries suffice  
  - Pressures can be kept out
  - Necessary processes are intact and do not rely on unprotected areas
      - (e.g. fire, hydrology, migration)
  - Protected areas are effectively managed...

## Protected area effectiveness?

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'centre', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/protected_areas_map.png")
```

Protected Areas (PAs) cover ~17% of land and ~8% of oceans ***BUT*** climate change and other threats are reshaping ecosystems and undermining their effectiveness at protecting biodiversity...

## Determinants of Protected Area Effectiveness

.pull-left[
The effectiveness of a protected area in achieving the desired conservation outcomes is influenced by two main factors:

- **Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME)**: How well the PA is managed, including planning, enforcement, resource allocation, community engagement, etc.
- **Change Drivers**: External pressures such as climate change, invasive species, pollution, altered ecosystem processes and land-use change that can impact the PA's ecosystems and biodiversity and the extent to which we can mitigate or adapt to them.

Unfortunately, both are hugely challenging!

## Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME)

.pull-left[

There are a number of different PAME methodologies, but most are based on a similar framework and share common elements, e.g.:
- Planning: Clear objectives, zoning, management plans, etc
- Resources: Adequate funding, staffing, infrastructure
- Enforcement/implementation: Effective patrolling, law enforcement and other management activities
- Community Engagement: Involving local communities and stakeholders
- Monitoring and Evaluation: Regular assessment of management effectiveness and ecological outcomes

South Africa employs an adapted version of the the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), called METT-SA.

## Change Drivers?

Protected areas are subject to all the usual suspects...

Some of these they are aimed at combating (e.g. habitat loss), while others may not have been anticipated when the PA was established (e.g. climate change, invasive species).

Some can be managed, given sufficient resources (e.g. invasive species), while others are largely out of the control of PA managers (e.g. climate change).

## Climate Change Velocity

The combination of climate varying in space and changing over time means that average climate conditions are shifting in space over time. 

Species and ecosystems may need to move to track their climate niche...

The rate at which climate conditions are shifting in space is called **climate velocity**.

Climate velocities are not uniform across the landscape, and can be very high in flat areas with shallow climate gradients (e.g. tundra, oceans) and low in mountainous areas with steep climate gradients.

## Multiple Dimensions of Climate Change...

.pull-left[

The different local and regional dimensions of climate change have different implications for species and ecosystems and their conservation.

Local dimensions relate to what species/ecosystems have to cope with in situ (e.g. warming, drying, extremes)

Regional dimensions relate to how far species/ecosystems may need to move to track their climate niche (e.g. climate velocity, direction, distance to suitable climate and barriers to movement).

## Protected Areas and Shifting Climate...

.pull-left[

Protected areas may not be located in areas that will remain suitable for the species and ecosystems they were established to protect.

Protected areas often protect fragments of the landscape (and thus climate space), and may not be large or connected enough to allow species to move in response to climate change.

Having only fragments of the habitat and climate space of species or ecosystems may make them more vulnerable to extinction or collapse.

## Protecting Areas under Climate Change

.pull-left[
A systematic review by [Ranius et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-022-01779-z) identified 5 key principles for climate-smart protected area design and management (_adaptation_ options):

- Ensure sufficient connectivity;
- Protect climate refugia; 
- Protect a few large rather than many small areas; 
- Protect areas predicted to become important for biodiversity in the future;
- Complement  permanently  protected  areas  with temporary protection.

## Protecting Areas under Climate Change

The above address **direct impacts** of climate change:
- Species loss, or range shifts towards cooler areas
- Phenological mismatches (e.g. flowers and pollinators)
- Habitat loss (corals, alpine, Arctic)

...but there are also **indirect impacts** and interactions with other change drivers:
- Invasive species
- Disturbance regimes (fire, storms, pests)
- Hydrological change

Often, the most important first step is to manage these interacting threats better...

Left to right:

**Assisted range expansion**
  — The human-assisted movement of species to areas just outside their established range, facilitating or mimicking natural range expansion — Intermediate risk

**Assisted long-distance migration** — The human-assisted movement of species to areas far outside their established range (beyond areas accessible through natural dispersal) — Higher risk

## Protected Areas and Climate Mitigation?

**Mitigation roles:** 

--

- Carbon storage (forests, peatlands, mangroves).
- Avoided deforestation.  
- REDD+ and policy integration.  
- Co-benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA).

## Take-home


> - PA effectiveness depends on both management and external pressures.
- Global change drivers like climate change undermine the static PA model.  
- Climate-smart approaches require connectivity, adaptation, and integration.
- Unfortunately, there is much we have yet to learn...
    - But we're improving our tools for monitoring and learning (and thus managing PAs)
- PA can contribute to climate mitigation via carbon storage.
