## Introduction

- Protected Areas (PAs) cover ~17% of land and ~8% of oceans.  
- Climate change is reshaping ecosystems and undermining PA effectiveness.  
- **Key Questions:**  
  1. How does climate change affect PAs?  
  2. Can PAs contribute to climate solutions?  
  3. How should we rethink conservation in a changing climate?  

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

- Explain how climate change threatens biodiversity inside PAs.  
- Assess the role of PAs in both adaptation and mitigation.  
- Critically evaluate strategies for climate-smart conservation.  

---

## Protected Areas: A Refresher

- IUCN definition and categories.  
- Traditional role:  
  - Safeguard species and ecosystems.  
  - Provide ecosystem services.  
- Assumptions:  
  - Stable habitats and species ranges.  
  - Static boundaries suffice.  

---

## Climate Change Impacts on PAs

**Direct impacts:**
- Species range shifts (poleward, upslope).  
- Phenological mismatches.  
- Habitat loss (corals, alpine, Arctic).  

**Indirect impacts:**
- Invasive species.  
- Disturbance regimes (fire, storms, pests).  
- Hydrological change.  

---

## Case Study: Kruger National Park

- Altered rainfall and fire regimes.  
- Shifts in vegetation and herbivore dynamics.  
- Management challenge: balancing biodiversity, tourism, and resilience.  

---

## Protected Areas as Climate Solutions

**Adaptation roles:**  
- Climate refugia.  
- Corridors and connectivity.  
- Dynamic, adaptive management.  

**Mitigation roles:**  
- Carbon storage (forests, peatlands, mangroves).  
- Avoided deforestation.  
- REDD+ and policy integration.  

---

## Climate Policy Context

- **Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework** (30x30).  
- **Paris Agreement** synergies.  
- Nature-based solutions at global scale.  

---

## Traditional vs. Climate-Smart PAs

### Traditional
- Isolated reserves  
- Static boundaries  
- Species assumed stable  
- Vulnerable to climate change  

➡️  

### Climate-Smart
- Networks & connectivity  
- Refugia & buffer zones  
- Adaptive management  
- Integrated with people & landscapes  
- Mitigation via carbon storage  

---

## Wrap-up

- Climate change undermines the static PA model.  
- Climate-smart approaches require connectivity, adaptation, and integration.  
- Conservation may need to shift focus from protecting *places* to protecting *processes*.  

---

## Discussion

> Should conservation shift from protecting **places** to protecting **processes** under climate change?
