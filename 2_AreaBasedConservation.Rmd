## Why protect area?

#### The number of species increases with area...

**The species-area relationship** is described by the **species-area curve**, a graphical relationship in which increases in area ( $A$ ) are associated with increases in the number of species ( $S$ ). 

The curve can be described by the equation $S = cA^z$, where $c$ and $z$ are constants fitted to the data.

Taking the logarithm of both sides makes the relationship linear $log S = log C + z log A$.

The relationship holds for a wide range of ecosystems with many different types of organisms.

## The [Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/)

#### 4 goals for 2050 and 23 targets for 2030

The first part of Goal A:
> _"The integrity, connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems are maintained, enhanced, or restored, substantially **increasing the area** of natural ecosystems by 2050"_

Targets 1, 2 and 3 are all area-centric:
> Target 1: _"...to bring the loss of **areas** of high biodiversity importance...close to zero by 2030..."_

> Target 2: _"...by 2030 at least 30 per cent of **areas** of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and marine and coastal ecosystems are under effective restoration..."_

> Target 3: _"...by 2030 at least 30 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and of marine and coastal areas... are effectively conserved and managed [in] **protected areas** and other effective area-based conservation measures..."_

## Where or how much do we need to protect?

## Global vs Local conservation priorities?

.pull-left[
### Global

- Require datasets with global coverage
  - Often trades off with data quality/resolution and/or taxonomic groups included
  - Typically based on bioregional classification and specialist opinion
- Analyst lacks local knowledge of all areas and/or access to experts for input
- Data, computation power and other constraints typically limit analyses to course spatial grain (countries, degree grid squares, etc)
- Cannot consider local nuance
]

.pull-right[
### Local

- Can include patchy local data
  - Allows including higher quality data and usually more taxonomic groups
  - Usually based on primary biodiversity data and aware of their flaws/assumptions
- Analyst typically has good local knowledge and/or access to experts for input
- Analyses can be done at very fine spatial grains if the data and computation allow (10s to 100s of metres)
- Can account for local nuance
  - biodiversity, resources, institutions, policy, trade-offs
]

## Local conservation priorities and planning

.left-column[
Historically, many conservation areas are focused on either a target **species** or a broader **ecosystem** - e.g. Bontebok National Park vs the [Cape Floral Region Protected Areas UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1007/)

I'm not going to dwell on this, but it'll come up repeatedly. Ultimately both usually require protected areas.

## Local conservation priorities and planning

.pull-left[

In modern conservation planning, we typically already have some **historical protected area network** or similar and the goals are to improve on existing conservation efforts.

Unfortunately, the existing networks usually contain a **biased sample** of biodiversity, usually focused on charismatic species or remote places and other areas that are unsuitable for commercial activities.

> _"A more systematic approach to locating and designing reserves [...] will need to be implemented if a large proportion of today’s biodiversity is to exist in [...] future..."_ - [Margules and Pressey 2000](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35012251)

This is called ***Systematic Conservation Planning***.

]

## Systematic Conservation Planning

1. Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
2. Identify conservation goals for the planning region
3. Review existing conservation areas
4. Select additional conservation areas
5. Implement conservation actions
6. Maintain the required values of conservation areas
