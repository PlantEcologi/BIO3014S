## WARNING!!!

This lecture is a bit of a mash-up of different topics. My aim is to give you some idea of species and ecosystem threat assessments and some idea of how they are applied globally and in South Africa, to give you local context. Be aware that I am glossing over a lot of important detail to squeeze it into one lecture. There are things I have missed and potentially even misrepresented in order to simplify...

## History of Conservation

We don't have a good record to be honest...

In reality, we know many civilizations controlled access to resources like hunting, timber and the like. 

  - There is good record from pre-colonial South Africa, but it more than likely extends back thousands of years in many parts of the world.

The common denominator is sparing a resource. All that has really changed (or is changing) is the focal resource, how we view and quantify it, and who and what we are sparing it for (i.e. the _priorities_).

  - Note that these "priorities" are constantly in flux and vary between cultures, countries, reserves, etc. This can cause conflict, but global treaties aim at coming to some degree of agreement.

Wikipedia will point you to John Evelyn's work (1662, 1664) on forests and timber production, but that's just the written record (in English at least...).

The first complete assessment of an entire flora...

2577 (13%) of South Africa’s plant taxa are threatened with extinction

A further 2232 (11%) are listed under other categories of conservation concern

## The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species - ***Incomplete!***

.pull-left[

Just over 150 000 species have been assessed to date (in ±60 years). ~62 000 are plants.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/iucn_rls_progress.png")

Only a few groups have near-complete coverage (pictured above)...

This is a huge achievement, but...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/species_number_gaston_2010.png")
```

There are an estimated 8 million species!!! Many yet to be described!

## The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species - ***Still useful!***

Especially for taxonomic groups that are mostly complete, e.g. mammals, birds and amphibians...

<br>

These can be used in interesting ways, because we have data on the threats faced by the species, e.g.

- [Harfoot et al. 2021](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01542-9) _Using the IUCN Red List to map threats to terrestrial vertebrates at global scale_

Many ways in which patchy data can still be useful!

## Take-home

>*The conservation of resources is likely as old as cooperation among humans.*

>*There are many facets of biodiversity and ways to measure them that could be used as conservation priorities.*
> - *It's important to think about the potential negative impacts of any one measure or priority*

>*Modern conservation of biodiversity is largely focused on trying to avoid losing anything. Other criteria come into conservation planning, but species and ecosystem threat assessments are high up there.*

>*The IUCN have developed globally accepted guidelines for species and ecosystem threat assessments.*
> - *Unfortunately, not all species and ecosystems on the planet have been assessed...*

>*South Africa has assessed all ecosystems and most species for a number of taxonomic groups (plants, amphibians, fish, etc) and we use this for a number of purposes*
> - *Systematic Conservation Planning - e.g. Protected area expansion strategies*
> - *Our ecosystems are afforded protection under law, even outside reserves*
