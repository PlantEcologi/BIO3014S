## WARNING!!!

This lecture is a bit of a mash-up of different topics. My aim is to give you some idea of systematic conservation planning, species and ecosystem threat assessments and some idea of how they are applied in South Africa to give you local context. Be aware that I am glossing over a lot of important detail to squeeze it into one lecture. Note that it is also a crude (and partial!) summary by someone who has not been central to this endeavor, so there are things I have missed and potentially even misrepresented...

## History of Conservation

We don't have a good record to be honest...

In reality, we know many civilizations controlled access to resources like hunting, timber and the like. 

  - There is good record from pre-colonial South Africa, but it more than likely extends back thousands of years in many parts of the world.

The common denominator is sparing a resource. All that has really changed (or is changing) is how we view and quantify that resource, and who and what we are sparing it for (i.e. the _priorities_).

  - Note that these "priorities" are constantly in flux and vary between cultures, countries, reserves, etc. This can cause conflict, but global treaties aim at coming to some degree of agreement.

Wikipedia will point you to John Evelyn's work (1662, 1664) on forests and timber production, but that's just the written record (in English at least...).

Prioritizing conservation

- Mapping biodiversity…
- Local vs Global priorities

- Species
    - Mapping
    - Threat assessments (and protection levels)
          - Spatial traits
          - Non-spatial traits? E.g. Do mutualisms matter?
                - Need to consider the type of threat (Murray et al. 2014)
          - Problems with basing conservation priority on (threatened) species?
              - Not all species have been assessed
              - Not all species have been identified and named!
              - Species locality data are imperfect
              - We are bias in our selection of species (“charismatic” megafauna vs nondescript etc species like sedges)

    - Ecosystems
          - Mapping 
          - Threats


Conservation planning
  - Targets
  - Spatial products
  - Optimization algorithms
  - GIS vs ecology?

“It is a hard reality that virtually all countries, no matter how well resourced, take conservation and land use decisions based on highly patchy and imperfect data - if indeed any data at all.” - Barnard et al. 2017

These and other photographs taken by astronauts and early satellites in the late 1960s and early 1970s were among the first _earth observations_ from space.

They highlight Earth as a single vulnerable, interconnected system in the darkness of space with limited resources (and space) and no escape options...

They sparked a new era both in environmental consciousness and in the tools available to better understand and protect our environment.

## Learning goals for this lecture:

- To provide an introduction to this module
- To highlight that much of biodiversity conservation is a _spatial_ problem
- To give you some idea how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing are used in conservation
- To ground the above with local examples

---
## But there are many tough questions...

- Where should we put (or expand) protected areas?
- How do we ensure the effectiveness of our protected areas?
- How do we protect biodiversity outside protected areas?

Answering these requires:
  - Mapping biodiversity
  - Identifying and assessing threats to biodiversity
  - Setting (spatial) biodiversity conservation priorities
  - Protected area design
  - Tools to inform management
    - Monitoring change in biodiversity and other key variables (e.g. fire, land cover change, etc)
